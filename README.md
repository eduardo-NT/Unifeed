# Unifeed: Full-Stack Feedback Platform to Turn Feedback into Insights

A modern platform to collect, categorize, and visualize feedback from multiple sources. Unifeed helps teams transform raw input into clear, actionable insights. It ships with a clean user interface, smart tagging, and insightful dashboards. Built with a combination of React on the frontend, Node.js on the backend, and Supabase as a data layer.

[Unifeed is designed for teams that want to move from scattered notes to structured data. From product teams to support squads, Unifeed provides a consistent workflow to capture feedback, organize it, and uncover trends with visual dashboards.] This document will walk you through what the project offers, how to run and contribute, and how to extend it for your own needs. The goal is to have a practical guide you can rely on whether you are evaluating the project, starting development, or planning a deployment.

Core ideas and design
- Clarity first: Interfaces are designed to minimize cognitive load. Users find what they need quickly, and the system helps them see the story behind the data.
- Structured feedback: Raw comments become data points. Tags, sources, sentiment, and metadata are captured consistently.
- Actionable insights: Dashboards surface trends, distributions, and heatmaps that guide decision making.
- Safe collaboration: Access controls and auditing help teams work together without sacrificing security.
- Extensibility: The platform is designed to incorporate more data sources, new analytics, and custom workflows.

Tech stack at a glance
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive UI building
- Backend: Node.js with Express or a similar lightweight framework
- Data layer: Supabase for database, authentication, and storage
- Language and utilities: TypeScript for type safety; NLP components for tagging and content analysis
- Auth and security: JWT-based auth, role-based access control
- Dev tooling: Jest for tests, ESLint/Prettier for code quality, GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Hosting and deployment: Typically, frontend can be deployed to static hosts or edge networks; backend can run in containers or serverless environments; Supabase handles the database layer

Getting started
This section helps you run Unifeed on your development machine. The goal is to get a working instance quickly so you can explore features and test integrations.

Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ (or the version you prefer for your environment)
- npm or pnpm or yarn as your package manager
- Access to a Supabase project or the ability to run a local Supabase stack
- Basic familiarity with environment variables and REST APIs

Initial setup
1) Acquire the code
- Clone the repository locally
- Install dependencies
2) Configure environment
- Copy the example environment file
- Fill in DSN, API keys, and secrets
3) Run locally
- Start the backend service
- Start the frontend service
- Verify that the UI loads and authentication works

What youâ€™ll run
- Backend: node src/server/index.js or npm run start:server
- Frontend: npm run start or yarn start
- Local database: a local Supabase stack or docker-compose setup

Recommended workflow
- Start with the basic data model and authentication
- Import a small set of sample feedback from a CSV
- Create a few tags and a dashboard to visualize simple trends
- Expand to multiple sources and more complex tagging
- Iterate on data quality and tagging accuracy

Environment and configuration
- Environment variables are critical to secure operation and data access
- A typical environment file includes:
  - DATABASE_URL: database connection string
  - SUPABASE_URL: base URL for Supabase service
  - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: client key for public operations
  - JWT_SECRET: secret key for signing tokens
  - APP_BASE_URL: URL of the frontend application
  - THIRD_PARTY_API_KEYS: keys for embeddings, NLP, or other integrations
- If you plan to run NLP or sentiment analysis locally, you may need additional libraries and models
- Secrets should be managed securely in production (e.g., via a vault or environment management system)

Working with sources and data
- Multiple feedback sources can feed into the platform
- You can map sources to data fields, define how data is normalized, and set up enrichment steps
- Data imports can be performed via CSV, JSON, or via API integrations
- Source configuration includes:
  - Name and type
  - Endpoint or data path
  - Connection credentials
  - Data mapping rules
  - Scheduling for automatic imports
- Validation rules ensure data quality during import
- Data normalization ensures that fields like date, language, and user identifiers follow a consistent format

Smart tagging and NLP
- Tagging helps uncover themes across feedback items
- NLP features include:
  - Topic extraction to suggest candidate tags
  - Sentiment analysis to categorize feedback as positive, neutral, or negative
  - Language detection and translation hooks
  - Contextual tag suggestions based on content and history
- Tag management lets admins create, merge, or rename tags
- Tagging is kept lightweight to minimize noise and improve signal
- Manual tagging remains possible for human-in-the-loop workflows

Dashboards and visualizations
- Dashboards are configurable views for stakeholders
- Visual components may include:
  - Bar charts for tag frequency
  - Time-series charts for trends
  - Pie charts for source distribution
  - Heatmaps for topic intensity
  - Tables for raw feedback with sortable columns
- Dashboards support user-specific views and role-based access
- Visualizations can be exported as images or CSV for reporting

API and integration points
- RESTful API endpoints for core operations
- JWT-based authentication for secure calls
- CRUD operations for feedback items, tags, sources, and dashboards
- Webhooks or polling endpoints to ingest real-time data from external services
- Import helpers to ingest data from common formats (CSV, JSON)
- You can extend API capabilities with custom plugins or adapters

Security and access control
- JWT-based authentication with short-lived tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions
- Data access policies enforced at the database layer
- Secure default configurations with least privilege
